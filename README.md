To be completed. This is a somehow a redesign and rewrite of my
[melt-monitor-2015](http://github.com/bstarynk/melt-monitor-2015) in
Go.  So the
[melt-monitor-2015/README.md](https://github.com/bstarynk/melt-monitor-2015/blob/master/README.md)
is giving *some* motivation (but a *lot* of details and design have
changed).

Compilable on Linux/Debian/x86-64 (Sid) with Go 1.8 at least.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file for installation instructions and
dependencies, which you should perhaps read before even `git
clone`-ing our repository :exclamation:
